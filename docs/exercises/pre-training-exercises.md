## Pre-training learning and exercises

### Introduction
In order to get the most out of the induction training, you need to understand some of the basics of web development before the course begins.

### Aims
This part of the course should enable you to understand the basics of the following technologies and concepts:
* Web development software
* Files
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* How the web works
* Version control and Git

If you're keen, you can delve into these further - the more you learn before the course, the more you will get out of it.

### The essentials
#### Web development
As a complete beginner, the best place to start is [MDN - Getting started with the web \[1\]][1]. This course will give you a gentle, hands-on introduction to web development - please go through every section except the one about publishing your website. Note that we will be using [Visual Studio Code \[2\]][2] during the training course so it is recommended you use this as your source code editor.

#### Version control
Another crucial concept for software development is that of version control, and the most widely-used tool in this area is Git. Some useful links can be found at [Resources to learn Git \[3\]][3] - the first half of the [Git Handbook \[4\]][4] page (prior to where GitHub is discussed) defines some key concepts and an exercise-based introduction to Git can be found at [Learn Git Branching \[5\]][5]. 

### Further learning
Once you've understood the basics, further training including assesments can be found on MDN Web Docs:
* [Learning HTML: Guides and tutorials \[6\]][6]
* [Learn to style HTML using CSS \[7\]][7]
* [JavaScript \[8\]][8]

Of all the above concepts, the most important for you to learn is JavaScript, since understanding more about this will prepare you both the training course and learning other programming languages when you start work.

### Pluralsight
Civica are dedicated to your ongoing growth and development: as such, [Pluralsight \[9\]][9] subscription will be provided when you start work. IN the meantime, you can start at a free trial and use the training courses to reinforce the knowledge learned so far and learn a bit about some more useful concepts, such as:
* [Introduction to npm as a Build Tool \[10\]][10]
* [Test-driven Development Using React- \[11\]][11]
