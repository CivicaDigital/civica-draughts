# Introduction
This document describes specifies the coding exercises you are to do during the Induction course. Please follow the instructions carefully and always feel free to ask for help when you need it.

## Context
For each of the exercises below you should aim to:
 * Write the code required to the relevant standards – ESLint will warn you of any deviations in this regard by displaying error messages in the Problems panel in Visual Studio Code.
 * Compile the code without any errors or warnings – when you run the application from the Terminal panel in Visual Studio Code, any errors or warnings will be output there prior to the application starting up.
 * Check the code yourself, both for correct function and optimal conciseness.
 * Have it reviewed.
 * Rework the code if you are asked to.

The exercises will typically consist of a sequence of steps, giving you guidance on what to do but not how to do it. You should be able to locate the required commands/menu options from reference material handed out previously or from online documentation and tutorials.

Whilst you are doing the exercises, you will be supervised on a part-time basis, with more supervision when you are starting a new topic and less as you gain more experience. This is just like the real world of work, where your manager is not always available to answer your questions immediately. You will need to develop strategies to cope with this. Work as a team and help each other when necessary. Also try a different exercise if you get truly stuck.

Your work will be assessed throughout the course and you will receive a formal assessment with a report at the end.
