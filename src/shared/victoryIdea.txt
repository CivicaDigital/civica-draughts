  * Add a check for victory conditions and identify the winner accordingly on the page.

To check if a player has won, see if every remaining piece is only black or white.

If every (piece.black===true) || every (piece.black===false), call Victory function.

To do this, we could create a flag that is set to equal the first element(piece) in pieceArray.
        boolean colourCheck = pieceArray[0].black.

We then loop through each other piece, and if colourCheck does not equal a piece, break out of function.
Otherwise if colourCheck is equal to all pieces, run Victory.
        for( i = 1; pieceArray.length-1; i++){
          if(colourCheck===pieceArray[i].black){
            break;
          } else {
            //Trigger Victory Event
          }
        }


Upon victory, trigger event window displaying Winner's name. Window contains a button that when clicked starts a new game.


if !( destinationArray.some ( piece => piece.black === true) && ( destinationArray.some ( piece => piece.black === false)) {
  //VICTORY
}
